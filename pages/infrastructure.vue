        <p>The capacity of the Test Bed is as follows:</p>
        <ul class="ml-5">
          <li>Pumps with flow rates from 1m/h to 250m3/hr can be tested.</li>
          <li>Heads of up to 200m are measured with standard equipment.p</li>
          <li>
            Power is measured with a twin element wattmeter, connected through
            potential and current transformers, which are in turn connected to
            two phases of power supply to motor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meter drives up to 200kw can be used for testing.
